# Metric-Drift-Compensation-Network
The model code for the paper “Metric Network for E-Nose Drift Compensation: Few-Shot Learning for Robust Gas Sensing” published in IEEE Sensors Journal.

Execute the train file to train the model, and modify the parameters of train_mouths and test_mouths to specify the batches used for training and testing.
